# Predicting the Stock Race ML Model (2014-2018)

## Motivation
#### My group and I were assigned a project that required us to take some public data and preform some task using machine learning.

## Description
#### WMy group and I took stock data from (2014-2018) and set out to find which based of the data and the conclusions drawn by the different machine learning models, which stocks you should buy or not. First we started with the exploritory data analysis which consised of us taking the data and removing missing valuse and unimportant and repetitive attriubutes. Once we did that we needed to find the attributes with the highest relevance due to the sheer size of the dataset. Once we got the dataset narrowed down to the relevant columns we put the dataset therough different machine learning models. We used 80 20 training test splits for all test and based off our results we came to the conclusion that KNN and gradiant boosting yeilded the best results based on their accuracy score to what stocks where actually boguht.

## How to Use and Run
#### In this repository there are lots of pictures and charts, all of those are available inside the presentation. The important parts for the program include the .py file and the .cvs data files. Open the .py file and download all dependencies un-accounted for which you can tell by looking at the first coding cell in the notebook (ones you don't have will br highlighted). You can run all the cells one by one or you can run all at the top. here we made markdown comments explaining the reasons behind the types of test we are running
